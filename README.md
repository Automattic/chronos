# Chronos

Chronos is an R script that helps you analyze the distribution of time between two events.

## Installing R

If you've never used R before, you'll need to [install R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and optionally download a tool like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to run this script. Use `setwd()` to change the working directory to match the location of this script.

## How it works

In order for the script to work, all you need to do is to generate a CSV file with two columns, one containing the unix timestamp of the first event and the second containing a unix timestamp of the second event:

```
1350268044,1408676495
1307322538,1350061315
1307676110,1340667657
1307661905,1337311786
1307758702,1428877904
1307654497,1385588891
1308368305,1317787248
1307657774,1428201852
```

Add your CSV to the `data` directory, then update the last line of `chronos.R` to reference that file instead of the example file.

To analyze the data, within RStudio simply load the script using `source("chronos.R")`.

Here's the analysis of the included example data:

```
